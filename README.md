This is an email client written in Java, using Swing and JavaMail. It supports IMAP (including
disconnected IMAP), POP3, and unix-style mbox folders. It also has (alpha) support for encryption using PGP and S/MIME.

Forked from https://sourceforge.net/projects/pooka/

**NOTE for Windows Users**
The original developers of pooka created two different files named 'store.html' and 'Store.html' in the help docs folder. This will (obviously) cause issues and data loss on Windows systems.
FIXME: rename, merge, or just delete one of these files
